						<h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
						<time datetime="2021-04-15">April 15, 2021</time>
						<p>
							Implementing best practices and ideas for form design helps to improve user experiences. 
							These practices include ideas such as knowing how to format and size input fields, proximity 
							of labels with their input fields, and minimizing massive amounts information and breaking 
							it down into multiple steps to help prevent cognitive overload. Feedback is also great for user 
							experience. Feedback can include having a focus on the current input field the user is on, and 
							displaying error messages if their input invalid or incomplete. Feedback provides users with
							clear notice of whether they have filled in the inputs correctly and their form has been submitted 
							or that they need to make some changes. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I personally find feedback very helpful when filling out forms as well as actions that prevent 
							cognitive overload. A majority of the forms that I have filled were usually long with no indication 
							of how long it is. This discourages me as user from going through that experience again. An online 
							form that I have used was creating an account for a clothing website.
