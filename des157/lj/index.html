						<h2>Game UX Best Practices</h2>
						<time datetime="2021-04-29">May 18, 2021</time>
						<p>
							In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game UX Best Practices</a>, Amir Dori talks about best practices for mobile game design that helps with user experience. There are few things to consider such as UI Positions, Sliders, Pop-Ups, and more. Every design should focus on keeping the user engaged and wanting stay on the app. If there are pop-ups in which users have to make decisions, the positive or good decisions that are good for your game should be placed on the right. Pop-ups, which should be activitated by user interactions,  should also avoid the "X" design choice as users may instantly close the pop-up. The close button should also appear after a short delay so users read the content before immediately closing it. Presenters (game characters) are also a good design choice, especially when it comes to "rate us" and "store" dialogs, where the looking that the user. All these best practices not only benefits the user, but you as the game designer as well, as it keeps the users on your app.

						<h2>Every Picture - Visual Thinking Analysis Learning Journal</h2>

							<img src="ama.jpeg" alt="Sunset photo" style="width:100%">
							<figcaption>Ama Dadzie, 2021</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							This image is interesting because of the colors in the image. It's a picture of the Bay Area taken at sunset which you are able to see in the image, as well at the silhouette of the houses, the trees, and the other surroundings. This relates to the topic of my archive collection because this is one of the first images I remember taking after saving up to buy my own camera. I had been on a walk with my mom and dog, and we stopped on a hill by our house to take in the view. I had been so excited with result. Seeing that I could capture something like that, all I wanted to do was continue taking pictures. This collection says something about me because it shows different parts of my life. From going on trips with my family and enjoying sometime together, or attending events that bring me joy.

						<p> I think this image is about her favorite things. Things that she has seen or attended and liked and wanted to save it to remember. I think what's really interesting is the difference in all the images, from the colors to the pattern and shapes. They are all cut differently and are so different from one another but still works because of their placement among each other and how they are arranged. I think the most obvious aspect is that it seems to be a collage. And the most mysterious aspect is wondering just how these images relate together or if they represent an outing that was taken. I want to know what all the little different cutouts represents.</p>

						<h2>Use of images and Interactions</h2>
						<time datetime="2021-04-29">April 29, 2021</time>
						<p>
							I took a look at <a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/" target="_blank">Hello Monday's</a> website. I thought the use of images and interactions was very fun and engaging, particularly the interactions. I would hover over the different projects to see the animations. It was so fun to see what would happen when I hovered over a particular image. They were all unique and different. Each animation, when hovering the image related to the image and the project. When you hovered over the edge of an image and some objects, their shape became distorted and fluid. Having the mouse change to what I believe is a face was also fun. I thought the images were well placed as well, displayed like a gallery. There was a mix between illustrations and photographs but because each image corresponded to a project it wasn't distracting.

						<h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>
						<time datetime="2021-04-15">April 22, 2021</time>
						<p>
							Modals (also known as overlays or dialogs) is content that sits on top of the main page. 
							User's are meant to interact with it before being able to interact with the main page once more. 
							Modals are great for when you want to grab the user's attention, need user input, when you need 
							to show addiction information in content (as well as not in context). Modals are appropriate in 
							these situations but they have become overused so much that users automatically dismiss these windows 
							when they pop up. 
						</p>
						<p>An effect and appropriate modal window should have some key features:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Users should be able to close the model, which can be done through a button, 
									keyboard press, or clicking outside of the window</li>
								<li>It should have a descriptive title </li>
								<li> Buttons should be name appropriately and should be actionable</li>
								<li> The modal should not be very large, and should not use more than 50% of the page</li>
								<li>Use a Lightbox effect when a modal is opened. This will darken the background and bring attention to what you want the user to focus on, the modal</li>
								<li>Modals should be initiated by users and should not pop up automatically</li>
								<li>Avoid using modals on mobile device as the screen is too small and the content becomes difficult to see as well as navigate </li>
							</ul>

						<h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
						<time datetime="2021-04-15">April 15, 2021</time>
						<p>
							Implementing best practices and ideas for form design helps to improve user experiences. 
							These practices include ideas such as knowing how to format and size input fields, proximity 
							of labels with their input fields, and minimizing massive amounts information and breaking 
							it down into multiple steps to help prevent cognitive overload. Feedback is also great for user 
							experience. Feedback can include having a focus on the current input field the user is on, and 
							displaying error messages if their input invalid or incomplete. 
						</p>
						<p>Feedback provides users with clear notice of whether they have filled in the inputs correctly and 
							their form has been submitted or that they need to make some changes. I personally find feedback 
							very helpful when filling out forms as well as actions that prevent cognitive overload. A majority 
							of the forms that I have filled were usually long with no indication of how long it is. This discourages 
							me as user from going through that experience again. 
						</p>
						<p>An online form that I have used was creating an account on <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/account/create" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> 
							website. You are able to see how long the form is, and it is very short. It uses one column layout 
							and doesn't mark the mandatory fields with asterisks. On certain fields, once you click on it, it 
							provides more information about what the field is, or what is needed in that field. If the input 
							field is not filled out, it provides feedback by highlighting the section in red and bringing up 
							an error message. All the input fields are labeled and you also have the option to see your password. 
							I thought this was a great example of implementing best practices for forms.
