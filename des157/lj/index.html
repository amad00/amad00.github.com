						<h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
						<time datetime="2021-04-15">April 15, 2021</time>
						<p>
							Implementing best practices and ideas for form design helps to improve user experiences. 
							These practices include ideas such as knowing how to format and size input fields, proximity 
							of labels with their input fields, and minimizing massive amounts information and breaking 
							it down into multiple steps to help prevent cognitive overload. Feedback is also great for user 
							experience. Feedback can include having a focus on the current input field the user is on, and 
							displaying error messages if their input invalid or incomplete. 
						</p>
						<p>Feedback provides users with clear notice of whether they have filled in the inputs correctly and 
							their form has been submitted or that they need to make some changes. I personally find feedback 
							very helpful when filling out forms as well as actions that prevent cognitive overload. A majority 
							of the forms that I have filled were usually long with no indication of how long it is. This discourages 
							me as user from going through that experience again. 
						</p>
						<p>An online form that I have used was creating an account on <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/account/create" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> 
							website. You are able to see how long the form is, and it is very short. It uses one column layout 
							and doesn't mark the mandatory fields with asterisks. On certain fields, once you click on it, it 
							provides more information about what the field is, or what is needed in that field. If the input 
							field is not filled out, it provides feedback by highlighting the section in red and bringing up 
							an error message. All the input fields are labeled and you also have the option to see your password. 
							I thought this was a great example of implementing best practices for forms.
