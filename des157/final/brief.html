                <p>This Hoover Tung’s website. I really like the gallery style layout of his photography. I thought it was well done perfect for what the website does, showcase his images. When you hover on an image, a light overlay with a plus sign appears on the image to indicate to the user that it is an interactive image and that it can be clicked on. His images are also separated into different pages, which I really liked, so that users can see his work that is specifically on landscape, or portraits. When the images are clicked on, it brings up an overlay that covers the whole screen where you can click on the left and right arrows to move on the next or previous images. There is also a play button that you can push for an automatic slideshow which can be stopped at any time. Having the option is really great so that users can decide.

                <p>This is Lauren Naylor’s website. I really like the simplistic look of it. As with Tung’s website, it’s also a gallery style layout which I am a fan of. When you hover over an image, it darkens with a search icon on it. You then know that you can click on the image. When you click on an image, a smaller overlay comes, not fully taking up the whole screen as you are able to still see the original page. The overlay is big enough to just fit the image with a short caption. I did notice that when you scroll while on the overlay, the page in the back continues to scroll which is something I think could be improved. I think the typography works very well on this site.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to showcase my photography just as the two websites I looked up do, in a gallery style. The images speak for themselves, and so the websites don’t use much text. My goal is to do something similar; to display some images that I’ve taken and really like. I like the idea of having separate pages for the different image categories, such as landscape, or micro, or portrait and that is something I would like to integrate in my project. My overall goal is to create a clean and minimalist site, without the clutter of text, just to display my images, and act as a photography portfolio.

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I want my design to be minimal. I will be keeping the layout the same, of having the title and other information on the left page, with the images on the right. I will be using a serif font to have a nice clean typography design. Rather than having the background color of the left page be black, I will have the whole background be white. Aside from my images which I will display in color at all times rather than the initial black and white until the user clicked on it, I will be using black and white, and possibly gray. I think using more than those colors may make the site seem too cluttered.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>My interaction will mostly consist of having an overlay when the user clicks on the image. The overlay will be a little bigger, but not completely fill the screen similar to what I have now in my Every Picture project, and to Naylor’s. However, I really like the idea of the automatic slideshow once the overlay is displayed with the user having the choice of manually clicking through the slideshow, or watching it automatically happen. So, I think that is another interaction I would like to include in there. I will also include a visual feedback when a user hovers over an image by having either a light or dark overlay to indicate to the user that there is some interaction with the image.

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to have my audience take in my images and look through them. I think I will be cutting down the text in my overlay to only show date and location if possible, so that the focus is more on the images rather than stories. I enjoy looking at other people’s photography and just think about the context in which it was taken and that’s the experience I want my audience to have. Rather than focusing on some long paragraphs, which they may ignore all together if they are there to just look at my images, they are able to just enjoy scrolling through my images.
