        <h2>Storyboard #1</h2>
        <img src="storyboard1.jpg">
        <p>It was really helpful to see what may be confusing to users. I got feedback about how changing format of how
            I
            wanted to display the format of other people responses while current user is answering questions so that
            it's
            not too overwhelming. In this case, show others responses the the specific question on the next page after
            the
            user has entered their response. Another feedback idea was having the music playing optional, which I plan
            to
            do.</p>
        <h2>Storyboard #2</h2>
        <img src="storyboard2.jpg">
        <p>This feedback gave me conflicting feelings about how to display people's responses. My partner liked my
            original
            idea of having the responses in the background behind the overlay that's asking the user a question because
            it
            would create a nice visual effect. However, they also added making that feature optional. So I am still
            deciding
            how to display that feature.</p>
