        <p>I thought this project was very beautiful. I liked the minimalist and simple aspect of it. It felt very
            calming. I was initially a little confused about what would result from taking this quiz but I thought it
            was very cool because of how interact it was and visual feedback you got as you rated each word. I do like
            the minimalistic aspect of it, however I felt like I needed more because I found myself playing around with
            the slider and giving each word a random rating. However, I liked the way it was designed and how calming
            the site was.</p>

        <p>I really liked the message of this website. I think the beauty and simplistic but impact nature of this
            website helped focus my idea and helped to develop it a bit more. I really liked the integration of quotes.
            I thought the song and animation really made this site more effective. I thought the mouse visuals helped to
            explain interactive parts of this site. However what was a little confusing to me, was once you clicked on
            one of the four celebrities, it seemed going back to choose another one was smoothly integrated into this
            site. I thought the audio of the celebrities speaking with the text on the screen was very powerful. I
            thought the simple animation were effective, such as the the moving circle. I really liked that and would
            like to include something similar on mine.
