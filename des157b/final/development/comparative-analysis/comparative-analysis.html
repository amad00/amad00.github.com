        <p>I thought this project was very beautiful. I liked the minimalist and simple aspect of it. It felt very
            calming. I was initially a little confused about what would result from taking this quiz but I thought it
            was very cool because of how interact it was and visual feedback you got as you rated each word. I do like
            the minimalistic aspect of it, however I felt like I needed more because I found myself playing around with
            the slider and giving each word a random rating. However, I liked the way it was designed and how calming
            the site was.</p>
