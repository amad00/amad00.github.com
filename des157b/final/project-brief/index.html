        <h1>Project Brief</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>This project is about self-image and emotions. It's a place to record how you are feeling in the moment.
                My intentions right now is to make to responsive.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to have a safe space to share how you are feeling. Similar to <a href="https://unpigeon.me/"
                    target="_blank">Unpigeon</a> I will be asking users a
                series of questions, however rather than having them rate how they feel about the questions, they will
                be able to write responses. I would like to save previous users answers to display as well. It will be a
                collection to look through and everything will be anonymous. I would like it to be meaningful like <a
                    href="https://www.beyond-beauty.co//" target="_blank">Beyond
                    Beauty</a>. They had a lot of information and animation but I thought their message was impactful
                and would
                like to do something similar. However my project will most likely be more minimal. Like <a
                    href="https://www.beyond-beauty.co//" target="_blank">Beyond
                    Beauty</a> I
                would also like to include some quotes throughout the site.

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I don't want the site to feel too overwhelming. I want to use colors that are calming and not too bright.
                The questions won't be very long, nor will they require a long response. Upon entering the site, they
                will be a welcome message and/or quote to greet the users. They will not see previous users responses
                until they've completed the questions so as to not influence them. When displaying all users responses,
                between every few, I will be including quotes. As for color, I think I will be going with black
                and white with a little bit of color or monochromatic. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>The interactions will mostly consist of having users adding a response and looking through other users
                responses. I would like to include some soothing music in the background. Users can choose to turn that
                off or on. I really liked little touches the <a href="https://www.beyond-beauty.co//"
                    target="_blank">Beyond
                    Beauty</a> included on their websites, such as with the
                cursor and the slight movements of circles and would like to include some interaction similar to that if
                possible and applicable and if time permits. When users are answering questions, I want to include some
                animation in the background of previous users answers to those specific questions, highlighting
                responses that are most often entered in some way. However, I'm still adjusting that feature to not make
                it feel overwhelming to the user while they're answering questions or change when that feature will come
                up. If not, I want to include an animation that reacts to the mouse cursor in thw background, similar to
                ParticleJS.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>My intended goal is to have the users feel comfortable and better expressing themselves, even if it's
                just marginally. In case they don't feel comfortable talking to someone in that moment or just in
                general, the goal of the site is to give them a platform without judgement. It doesn't matter what they
                are feeling, they are welcoming to respond however they would like, whether they are feeling really good
                or not. Because the idea is to record your feelings in that time, they won't be able to go back and edit
                it, but they are welcome to add another response if they wish.
