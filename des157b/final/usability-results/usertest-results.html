                <h3>The should be a way to navigate back to the welcome page</h3>
                <p>I noticed that when all the users were testing, they would click the title in the bottom left corner
                    or refresh the page. I realized that they were trying to go back to the welcome page. After testing
                    and asking users about it, they all said that there should be a way to navigate back to the welcome
                    page. They assumed the the title text at the bottom would take them there.</p>

            <h2>Observation 2</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Have the close button always be on the form</h3>
                <p> While users were playing around with the site and adding a response using the participate button or
                    when adding a new response from the gallery page, they would start the form and and answer a few of
                    the questions before stopping. They would either continue or refresh the page. I have a button to
                    close the form that comes up once the user decides to add a new response from the gallery page.
                    However after watching users interact with the sites and after listening to their feedback, the
                    consensus was to always have the button to close the form be displayed.

            <section>
                <h3>Have the buttons on the quote pages show up rigth away </h3>
                <p>When the quote page come up, most of the users would move their mouse around their screen trying to
                    figure out what to do next. I have a delay on the buttons being displayed on the quote pages to give
                    users time to read the text. However it seemed that the buttons should not be delayed because users
                    either weren't interetsed at the time to read the quote and/or couldn't figure how to move on. </p>

            <h2>Update Plan</h2>
            <p>I will update my final project by implementing most of the feedback given. I will be implementing changes
                that I talked about in my observations. I will be linking the title text to the welcome page or having
                another icon that will let the users go back the welcome page. I will have the close button
                always be on display on the forms, and I will also be removing the delay from the buttons on the quote
                pages. Some other changes are rephrasing one of the form questions, fixing horizontal scroll, and having
                an effect on the responses on the gallery view when hovering on it to indicate an interaction.</p>
